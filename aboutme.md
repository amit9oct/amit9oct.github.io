I am Software Engineer 2 at Microsoft, where I work in Azure Backup Team.

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and Masters in Mathematics at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). I am interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Causal Inference, and Program Synthesis.

Besides that, I also enjoy teaching mathematics to kids in new innovative ways, solving fun mathematics problems, reading about number theory and cryptography.
