Iâ€™m Amitayush Thakur, a Ph.D. at UT Austin advised by [Prof. Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/).

My research interest is program synthesis from natural language and input-output hints. I am also interested in interpretability of Deep Neural Nets through symbols.

Before joining UT, I worked as Software Engineer 2 at Microsoft in Distributed Systems, and before that as a research intern at Microsoft Research.

I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and Masters in Mathematics at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/).

Besides that, I also enjoy teaching mathematics to kids in new innovative ways, solving fun mathematics problems, reading about number theory and cryptography.
